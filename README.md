This app allows you to mitigate the stresses of a career search
By allowing users to add potential jobs to their dashboard and create an event based on that job. Events can include anything from calling a potential employer to what day their interview is at.
The user can also add comments to each job for anything such as addresses, phone numbers, and names.

## `How to Get started`

- First clone both the [server](https://github.com/etg624/job-search-server) and [client](https://github.com/etg624/job-search-app) repos.

- For the server make sure you have a local mongodb server running. Also, make sure you `npm install` after cding into the project directory. Run `node server.js` or just `nodemon` (if you have nodemon installed) and that will start the back end.

- For the client side make sure you cd into the project directory and `npm install`. After waiting for the project to install run `npm start` and `http://localhost:3000` should open with the app in your browser and voilÃ  ðŸ’ƒ ðŸ•º
